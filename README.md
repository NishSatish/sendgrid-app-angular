# SendgridApp

A quick start SendGrid implementation that provisions an Angular frontend.
Run ```npm install``` to install dependencies and get started.

# Using the SendGrid API

To use the SendGrid API, create a SendGrid account and obtain the API key from your SendGrid dashboard. Paste the key into the nodemon.json file as the value for the "SENDGRID_API_KEY" key. (NOTE: nodemon is not suited for production environments, so the API key must be injected through another method for production)
